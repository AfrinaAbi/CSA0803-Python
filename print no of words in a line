#Program to print number of words in a line and number of lines in a para
string=&#39;&#39;&#39;This is the most straightforward way to count the number
of lines in a text file in Python. The readlines() method reads all
lines from a file and stores it in a list. Next, use the len() function
to find the length of the list which is nothing but total lines present in a file.&#39;&#39;&#39;
str1=string.split(&quot;.&quot;)
str1.pop()
print(&quot;Number of lines: &quot;,len(str1))
print(&quot;Number of words in each line:&quot;)
for i in range(len(str1)):
words=str1[i].split()
#print(words)
print(&quot;Line&quot;,i+1,len(words))
